1 Climate Change: Analyzing Trends and Developing Sustainable Solutions
Objective
- Analyze current climate change data to identify trends in global temperature, CO2 emissions, and their environmental impact.
- Use data analytics tools and algorithms to predict future trends in climate
change.
- Develop a sustainable solution or recommendation for mitigating the effects of climate change, using data-driven insights.
- Use cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for data storage, processing, and analysis.
- Provide a detailed report and dashboard visualizing the analysis results
and predictions.
Resources Needed
- Access to climate data (e.g., temperature, CO2 emissions, deforestation
rates) from sources such as NASA, NOAA, or IPCC.
- Cloud account (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure) for data
storage, processing, and analysis.
- Computer with internet access and software tools (e.g., Python, Jupyter
Notebook, Visual Studio Code).
- GitHub account for version control and project collaboration.
- Data analysis and visualization tools: Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), or R.
